FQL2
====

About
-----

IDE and compiler for the next iteration of FQL, the functorial query language.

Build
-----

Compilation note: FPQL requires the built-in Eclipse compiler that ships with the Eclipse IDE for java developers.  The Oracle JDK compiler will fail with type-inference errors.

### Maven

First, install the `catdata-algs` dependency into your local Maven repository:

    git clone https://github.com/CategoricalData/catdata_algs.git
    cd catdata_algs/catdata_algs
    mvn install

Then, install `fql2` itself:

    git clone https://github.com/CategoricalData/fql2.git
    cd fql2/FQL_LIB/
    mvn package
